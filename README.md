# BEER BEER BEER BEER

Making a REST API for beer with Flask to learn some stuff.

Docker because I don't want to use virtual environments or directly install any tools.

Redis - I want to learn caching
Nginx - I want to learn about reverse proxies
Flask - Straight-forward Route Building. I like python.
PostgreSQL - The database I know how to work with especially in Docker
