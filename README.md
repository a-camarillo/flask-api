# BEER BEER BEER BEER

Making a REST API for beer with Flask to learn some stuff.

Docker because I don't want to use virtual environments or directly install any tools.

Da Stack:
- Redis - I want to learn caching
- Nginx - I want to learn about reverse proxies
- Flask - Straight-forward Route Building. I like python.
- PostgreSQL - The database I know how to work with especially in Docker

TO-DO:
- Create POST route for /brands and /brands/:id endpoints
- Create POST route for /beers and /beers/:id endpoints
- Add testing for /brands endpoint
- Add testing for /beers endpoint
- Configure Redis Cache
- Configure Nginx Reverse Proxy
- Profit????
